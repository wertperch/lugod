  Section 2:  Appointed Officers
     The following officerships are appointed by root.  Aside from being
     appointed, all other bylaws relating to officers apply.
     Appointed officers shall not be construed as legal agents of LUGOD, and
     are not authorized to bind LUGOD into financial or contractual
     obligations of any sort.

     i: The Webmistress/Webmaster designs and updates the webpage.  The
        duties of the webmistress/master shall include:

         b: to coordinate hosting matters with an ISP, including hosting
            the LUGOD mailing lists.
         c: to add materials provided by the other officers and committee
            Chairs to the website.

    ii: The LERT Coordinator is responsible for:

        public demonstration and outreach programs, including:
         a: Organizing demonstrations and public events, including compiling
            lists of who's attending what, when and where.

            lists

         d: Fostering an environment where people can feel safe in asking
            questions and participating in discussions in good faith without
            fear of getting flamed.

  Section 3:  Abdication
     In the event that an officer is unable to continue in their
     position, it would be greatly appreciated if they would give the
     rest of the officers notice at least one meeting beforehand, so that
     nominations and elections for a replacement can be made.  In the event
     that this is not feasible, the officer should find a replacement to be
     the acting officer until elections can be held.  Any help the outgoing
     officer can offer in transitioning their replacement would also be
     appreciated.  If an officer doesn't come to three meetings in a row
     without informing anyone, they will be considered to have abdicated,
     and nominations will be opened immediately for a replacement.

  Section 4:  Elections for Officership and Transition
     Nominations for elected officerships will be opened at the first
     general meeting of October, and will remain open
     until the beginning of the election at the next meeting.
     You are allowed to nominate yourself and nominations do not need to be
     seconded.  A person nominated for an officer position may decline the
     nomination at any time before the election takes place.

     Elections for elected officerships will be held the meeting after
     nominations are opened.  Voting is to be anonymous.  In the case where
     a candidate runs unopposed, typescript may ask that their approval for
     officership be passed by consent.  If there is an objection to consent,
     the candidate must be approved by a 2/3 majority of a general meeting.
     If no candidate is elected for a position, nominations will be re-opened
     for that position until the next meeting, when a new election will be
     held, and so forth, as necessary until all positions are filled.

     A newly-elected officer's term shall commence at the beginning of the
     meeting after elections are over.

Article II:  Procedures

  Section 1:  Bylaws Location
     The bylaws shall be publicly posted on LUGOD's website.

  Section 2:  Amendment of the Bylaws
     Anyone can bring up an amendment to the bylaws at any time.  The
     amendment will be addressed during the discussion period of the meeting.
     In the absence of objection to voting, a vote will take place
     immediately.  Otherwise voting will take place at the next meeting.
     A 2/3 majority will pass the amendment.

  Section 3:  sudo
     A bylaw may be temporarily suspended with the consent of root, sys,
     and at least one other elected officer.  The officers are strongly
     cautioned against abuse of this power; if tempted to use it more
     than once for the same thing, consider amending the bylaws.

  Section 4:  Small Change Clause
     Root and sys are allowed to make small changes to the bylaws.  The scope
     of these changes is defined by:

     i: Spelling, punctuation, formatting and change of wording are always
        fair game as long as it doesn't change the general meaning of the
        bylaw being changed.

    ii: Minor additions and deletions will need to be brought to an informal
        vote by all the officers (majority wins) to see if the change is
        minor enough to implement without a general LUGOD vote.

   iii: Anything else needs to be brought to a general vote at a regularly
        scheduled LUGOD meeting.
         
Article III:  Meetings

  Section 1:  When and Where
     Meetings will be held at least once per month, in the evening.
	  Meeting dates will be agreed upon by root and sys at least one month
	  in advance.  If a large number of members have an objection to the
     date of a meeting, root and sys may opt to choose a different date, but
     this should ideally be taken care of prior to the publication of
     announcements and the agenda.  The location should also be agreed upon
     by root and sys, based on input by the membership, and listed in the
     agenda.

  Section 2:  Parliamentary Procedure
     Meetings shall be conducted according to Robert's Rules of Order (New
     Revised) Edition, except where superseded by these Bylaws or the
     Constitution.  root may abridge these procedures for the purpose of
     expediting meetings.  Motions shall, in general, not require
     a second, and root should first try to pass them by consent if that
     seems likely to succeed.

  Section 3:  Agenda
     i: The tentative agenda should be sent to the vox-announce mailing list
        by root or his designee at least a week prior to the meeting.  The
        agenda may of course be amended by root before the meeting, and items
        may be added by a motion during the meeting.

    ii: The meeting shall commence with an Introduction of all members.  New
        members are invited to tell us a little about themselves.  This
        shall be followed by Announcements and New Business.  Then each
        committee's chair will provide a report, if necessary, and each
        report will be discussed by the members as a whole.  This will be
        followed by an open Discussion Forum and the Collection of
        voluntary member contributions.  One dollar is the basic suggested
        contribution.  /dev/null will then provide the financial report.
        The chair will then close the business section of the meeting and
        introduce the guest speaker, if available.

  Section 4:  Attendance Issues
     i: If an officer is unable to attend a meeting, sys shall take over
        their responsibilities, or assist the officer in question with finding
        an alternate stand-in.  This second course is highly recommended, as
        sys really has enough to do.

    ii: If a committee chair is unable to attend, their report may be
        presented by another committee member they designate, or presented
        by root.  In either case, they should provide a written report to vox
        and/or typescript.

Article IV:  Committees

  Section 1:  Formation
     root may form a new committee at any time, by appointing a committee
     chair.

  Section 2:  Committee Membership and Meetings
     The committee chair is in charge of keeping track of his/her
     committee's membership.  Anyone may join any committee they like.
     The committee chair may also call as many meetings as they feel are
     necessary to get the job done, but is advised to make sure the members
     that are interested can attend.

  Section 3:  Structural Change
     If a committee chair doesn't feel up to the task, they should request
     that root choose another person to chair the committee and resign.  It
     is the resigning committee chair's duty to brief and/or train their
     replacement so as to make the transition as easy as possible.

  Section 4:  Dissolution
     root may dissolve a committee at any time.  It is recommended that
     committees that have completed their assigned task, or whose task is
     found to be unachievable, be dissolved.  root's decision to dissolve a
     commitee may be overruled by a majority vote either of LUGOD as a whole,
     or of the committee's membership.

Article V:  Events

  Events shall be organized by a committee.  Members attending the event
  are requested to remember that they are representing LUGOD, and not behave
  in a manner that may tarnish the club's image.  People encountered in the
  course of the event with differing views and differing OSes should be
  treated with dignity and respect despite their somewhat questionable
  tastes.  Remember, LUGOD will not bail you out of jail, so please
  cooperate with any relevant authority figures.  Protests should be kept
  off the property of the protestee and not block the entryway to their place
  of business.

Article VI:  Grievances

  Anyone with a grievance against an officer, committee chair, another
  member, or LUGOD as a whole is asked to first try to resolve the matter
  informally with the person(s) involved.  If this fails, however, they are
  invited to institute a formal grievance during the discussion forum.
  When instituting a formal grievance, it is advisable to write down all
  facts (and feelings) pertinent to the grievance, as well as some possible
  suggestions on how to resolve the grievance.  Copies should be made for
  the entire membership in attendance, if possible.  Resolution of a grievance
  will be done by the membership as a whole, but neither the person whom the
  grievance is against nor the person instituting it shall be allowed to vote
  on any motions involved in the resolution.

Article VII:  LUGOD Emergency Response Team (LERT)

  Anyone with technical difficulty running Linux is invited to post a
  description of the problem to the vox mailing list.  Anyone interested in
  helping solve the problem is more than welcome to reply to the list, or
  invite the poster to contact them for further assistance.  Those who feel
  they benefit greatly from this system are encouraged (but by no means
  required) to make a voluntary contribution at the next meeting, in
  whatever amount they feel is feasible and appropriate.
