## About Us

LUGOD was formed in 1999 after Pete Salzman raised interest in a Linux Users' Group. He was joined by Bill Kendrick (and others) and the group rapidly took off.

Our goals are still to advocate the use of Linux and Open Source Software, to educate the community on these software alternatives, and to support and provide a social network for local Linux users.

LUGOD holds regular meetings twice a month. On the first Tuesday of each month, we hold a social gathering at a local restaurant or caf√©, and on the third Monday of each month we meet (usually at the Davis Public Library) for demonstrations, technical help events or informative presentations. (Location subject to change!)

We also hold other events and workshops (notably activism events at the Davis Farmers' Market) and seek to work with other local groups in the technology arena.

We maintain a number of active mailing lists (some with over 200 subscribers), an IRC channel for live chatting, and communities on social networks (Facebook and LinkedIn).

All our meetings, events and membership, are free and open to the general public. Join us!
